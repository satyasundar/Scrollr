## ScrollR
This is a simple but yet very useful chrome extension that allows you to measure how much you have scrolled in a webpage.

To load the extension, you can either download the zip file and load it as an unpacked extension or clone the repository and load it as an unpacked extension from the `chrome://extensions/` page.
